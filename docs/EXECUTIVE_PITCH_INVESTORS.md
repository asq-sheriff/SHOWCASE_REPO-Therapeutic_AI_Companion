## The Problem: A $1 Trillion Crisis

| The Reality | The Gap |
|-------------|---------|
| **54M Americans** age 65+ | **1:8 caregiver ratio** — not enough eyes |

| **30% have anxiety** | **2-5% utilization** of mental health services |
| **$1T annual cost** | **No 24/7 coverage** for mental health support |

**Assisted living facilities are understaffed, overwhelmed, and exposed to liability.** Families are anxious. Residents suffer in silence.
