## The Problem

**50% of assisted living residents suffer from depression. 30% have anxiety.** Yet mental health support is limited to business hours, understaffed facilities have 1:8-12 caregiver ratios, and crisis response takes 15-30 minutes — often too late.

**The cost:** $1 trillion annually in depression and anxiety treatment. Every 11 minutes, a senior in care experiences a mental health crisis.

| **Therapeutic AI** | 7 evidence-based agents (35% depression reduction) |
| **Voice Interface** | Accessible for elderly with vision/motor limitations |
